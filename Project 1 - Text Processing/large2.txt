 
He has enough money to last forever. He knows he needs to keep moving. You'll never find him. He's out of the picture. I saved his life, I owed him that, but now he and I are done. Which is exactly what you wanted, isn't it. You've always struck me as a very pragmatic man so if I may, I would like to review options with you. Of which, it seems to me you have two.

Option A, you kill me right here and now. Apparently I've made that very easy for you. You can kill me, no witnesses and then spend the next few weeks or months tracking down Jesse Pinkman and you kill him too. A pointless exercise it seems to me but that is Option A.

I continue cooking, you and I both forget about Pinkman. We forget this ever happened. We consider this a lone hiccup in an otherwise long and fruitful business arrangement. I prefer Option B.

He'll live. I asked to see you in order to... clear the air. There are uh, some... issues that could cause a misunderstanding between us and I think it's in our best interest to lay the cards on the table. My brother-in-law, moments before he was attacked, someone called to warn him. I believe that same person was protecting me.

Those two men, the assassins. I believe I was their prime target, but that somehow they were steered away from me to my brother-in-law. Because of this 'intervention' I am alive. And yet, I think that this person was playing a much deeper game. He made that phone call because he wanted a shootout not a silent assassination.

In one stroke, he bloodied both sides - set the American and Mexican governments against the Cartel, and cut off the supply of methamphetamine to the southwest. If this man had his own source of product on this side of the border, he would have the market to himself. The rewards would be... enormous.

We're both adults. I can't pretend I don't know that person is you. I want there to be no confusion. I know I owe you my life. And more than that, I respect the strategy. In your position, I would have done the same. One issue, which troubles me, I don't know what happens when our three-month contract ends. You know why I do this. I want security for my family.

No speeches. Short speech. You lost your partner today. What's his name - Emilio? Emilio is going to prison. The DEA took all your money, your lab. You got nothing. Square one. But you know the business and I know the chemistry. I'm thinking... maybe you and I could partner up.

I'm sorry, what were you asking me? Oh, yes, that stupid plastic container I asked you to buy. You see, hydrofluoric acid won't eat through plastic. It will, however, dissolve metal, rock, glass, ceramic. So there's that. How about something with some protein, maybe? Something green, huh? How are you even alive?

That is seventeen five - your half of the thirty-five thousand. Plus there's an extra fifteen in there, it's all yours, you've earned it. We made a deal. That's right. Because I think that we can do business together - we came to an understanding. Take a look at the money in your hand. Now just imagine making that every week. That's right. Two pounds a week, thirty-five thousand a pound.

Look... I feel like I'm running out of ways to explain this to you but once more, I shall try. This fly is a major problem for us. It will ruin our batch. And we need to destroy it and every trace of it, so we can cook. Failing that, we're dead. There's no more room for error. Not with these people.

You asked me if we were in the meth business or the money business. Neither, I’m in the empire business. I was under the impression that you had this under control. Well, that's what this is - problem solving. Skyler this is a simple division of labor - I bring in the money, you launder the money. This is what you wanted.

Who are you talking to right now? Who is it you think you see? Do you know how much I make a year? I mean, even if I told you, you wouldn't believe it. Do you know what would happen if I suddenly decided to stop going into work?

A business big enough that it could be listed on the NASDAQ goes belly up. Disappears! It ceases to exist without me. No, you clearly don't know who you're talking to, so let me clue you in. I am not in danger, Skyler. I AM the danger! A guy opens his door and gets shot and you think that of me? No. I am the one who knocks!

Did he speak to you? Would you just answer? What things? What people? A month ago, Gus was trying to kill both of us. And now, he pulls you out of the lab and employs you as... what... a, an assistant gunman? A tough guy? Does that make any sense to you? He says he sees something in you. What kind of game is he playing. Does he think you're that naïve? He can't truly think that you'd forget... let alone Gale, let alone Victor... and all the horror that goes along with all of that.

It's enough. This is still the best way. You go after him with a gun, you'll never get out of it alive. But with this... you slip it into his food or drink, there shouldn't be any taste or smell... thirty-six hours later... poof. A man his age, working as hard as he does... no one will be surprised. Mike can have his suspicions, but that's all they'll be. Please, one homicidal maniac at a time.

Look, I'll give you Jesse Pinkman, OK? Like you said, he's the problem, he's always been the problem and without him, we would... and he's in town, alright? He's not in Virginia or wherever the hell you're looking for him. He's right here in Albuquerque and I can take you to him, I'll take you right to him. What do you say?

It's complicated and I don't wish to discuss it. It's none of your concern. You know what, let's just say that I have a hell of a lot more on my mind, right now, than thinking about buying a damn car wash. Okay? So if you could just... please.

Stop. Stop! You keep saying that word - danger... danger! No and I have never used that word. I said things were complicated. And then you flew off the handle!

Gus is gonna make his move. I don't know when, I don't know where or how. All I know is it's gonna happen. Powerless to stop him.

I have been waiting. I've been waiting all day. Waiting for Gus to send one of his men to kill me. And it's you. Who do you know, who's okay with using children, Jesse? Who do you know... who's allowed children to be murdered... hmm? Gus! He has, he has been ten steps ahead of me at every turn. And now, the one thing that he needed to finally get rid of me is your consent and boy he's got that now. He's got it. And not only does he have that, but he manipulated you into pulling the trigger for him.

No! You don't even believe that! Gus has cameras everywhere, please. Listen to yourself! No, he has known everything, all along. Where were you today? In the lab? And you don't think it's possible that Tyrus lifted the cigarette out of your locker? Come on! Don't you see? You are the last piece of the puzzle. You are everything that he's wanted.

You're his cook now. You're the cook and you have proven that you can run a lab without me and now that cook has reason to kill me. Think about it! It's brilliant. So go ahead. If you think that I am capable of doing this, then go ahead. Put a bullet, in my head, and kill me right now. DO IT! Do it. Do it. Do it.

Saul, Saul... this man that we spoke of before, this... this person that you said could... could disappear me, get me a whole new life and make sure that I'm never found. Yeah I need him, Saul. Gus is gonna murder my whole family. I need this man now. Saul... now, Saul!

Anything suspicious? Well... then should we go? Any uh... Cartel news these days? Seems like I'm always reading something or other in the paper. I don't want to talk about it. To you or anyone else. I'm done explaining myself. Gus is dead. We've got work to do.

Jesse Jackson? Do you even... ah, I see you have a telephone at least. You know that blinking thing I've been calling you on? I will break this, I will BREAK THIS. Damn druggie idiot. Is this what you've been doing the whole time I've been trying to reach you?

The game has changed. The word is out. And you... are a killer. Apparently it's all over town. Somebody crossed you, you got angry, you crushed their skull with an ATM machine. Who cares! Just as long as it's our competitors who believe it and not the police.

Don't you see how great this is? You, you are a... Jesse look at me. You... are a blowfish. A blowfish! Think about it. Small in stature, not swift, not cunning. Easy prey for predators but the blowfish has a secret weapon doesn't he. Doesn't he? What does the blowfish do, Jesse. What does the blowfish do? The blowfish puffs up, okay?

The blowfish puffs himself up four, five times larger than normal and why? Why does he do that? So that it makes him intimidating, that's why. Intimidating! So that the other, scarier fish are scared off. And that's you! You are a blowfish. You see it's just all an illusion. You see it's... it's nothing but air. Now... who messes with the blowfish, Jesse? You're damn right. You are a blowfish. Say it again. Say it like you mean it. You're a BLOWFISH!

My partner was about to get himself shot. I intervened. He was angry because those two dealers of yours had just murdered an eleven year-old boy. Then again, maybe he thought it was you who gave the order.

He has enough money to last forever. He knows he needs to keep moving. You'll never find him. He's out of the picture. I saved his life, I owed him that, but now he and I are done. Which is exactly what you wanted, isn't it. You've always struck me as a very pragmatic man so if I may, I would like to review options with you. Of which, it seems to me you have two.

No shit! Right now you're Fredo. But, y'know, with some sound advice and proper introductions, who knows? I'll tell you one thing: you've got the right product. Anything that gets the DEA's panties in this big a bunch, you're onto something special. And I would like to be a small and silent part of it. Food for thought, yeah? So if you want to make more money and keep the money that you make, better call Saul!

Better safe than sorry. That's my motto. Yeah, you do seem to have a little 'shit creek' action going. You know, FYI, you can buy a paddle. Did you not plan for this contingency? I mean the Starship Enterprise had a self-destruct button. I'm just saying.

Look, let's start with some tough love, alright? Ready for this? Here it goes: you two suck at peddling meth. Period. Good! 'Oh boo-hoo, I won't cook meth anymore!' You're a crybaby! Who needs you?! Hey, I'm unplugging the website, so no more money laundering! How do you like that?!

Great, perfect you know... this is just. I told her you were my A Team. Oh, hello Mrs. White, the good news is the IRS has been paid off, the bad news is... ach, Jesus!

What am I eighth grade hall monitor? Current whereabouts? Let me tell you something, Mike. There are rules to this lawyer thing. Attorney client privilege, that's a big one. That's something I provide for you! If I give up Pinkman, then you're gonna be asking, old Saul gives 'em up pretty easy what's to keep him from giving me up? You see, so then, where's the trust?

Today's your lucky day. Look around, kiddo - it's all yours. You are now the owner of this fine establishment. Free? Oh ladies, cover your ears. No... not free. Look, hey... this is a squeaky clean, highly profitable (at least potentially), local institution. Look the bottom with favor by the chamber of commerce, better business bureau at three-hundred and twelve thousand dollars, it's a steal.

Don't you get it? On the outside it's a nail salon right, on the inside it's the best money laundering a growing boy could ask for. Wait, wait! Come back here. Sit. Come on, come on... humor me here for a second. You know you need to launder your money, right? Do you understand the basics of it - placement, layering, integration. Well, you wanna stay out of jail don't ya? You wanna keep your money and your freedom. Cause I got three little letters for ya, I - R - S. If they can get Capone, they can get you.

Hey look, here's you right - pink... Pinkman, get it? Here's your cash. You're out on the town, yeah you're partying hardy, you're knocking boots with the chicky babes and aww! Who's this? It's the tax man and he's looking at you. And what does he see? He sees a young fella, big fancy house, unlimited cash supply and no job. Now what is the conclusion the tax man makes? Aaaaannnt! Wrong! Millions times worse - you're a tax cheat. What do they do? They take every penny and you go in the can for felony tax evasion. Ouch! What was your mistake? You didn't launder your money! Now, you give me your money, okay that's called placement.

Hand me that little thing, bin. This is the nail salon, right. I take your dirty money and I slip it into the salon's nice clean cash flow - that's called layering. Final step - integration. The revenues from the salon go to the owner - that's you! Your filthy drug money has been transformed into nice clean taxable income brought to you by a savvy investment in a thriving business. Yeah and if you wanna stay a criminal and not become say a convict, then maybe you should grow up and listen to your lawyer.

Look, let's crunch some numbers. How much money are we laundering? Yeah, apparently. All right, $16,000 laundered at 75 cents on the dollar, minus my fee, which is 17%, comes out to $9,960. Congratulations, you've just left your family a second hand Subaru.

Two words: nail, salon. It's perfect for money laundering, it's a high-volume, cash-preferred business with a discreet workforce. Nobody does mista-me-know-nothing better than Mrs. Mukjayaporn and her gals.

Did you not plan for this contingency? I mean the Starship Enterprise had a self-destruct button. I'm just saying. Yeah, you do seem to have a little 'shit creek' action going. Hey, nobody appreciates a passionate woman more than I do. But uh, in this business... and Walt can back me up on this... the uh, number one rule is, don't take things personally.

Drum roll, please. Wait for it. Lazer tag. Lazer tag! 7,000 square feet of rollicking fun in the heart of northern Bernalillo County! It adds up perfectly. Walt's a scientist, scientists love lazers. Plus, they got bumper boats, so...

Yeah! Attorney-client privilege. I mean, that's a big one. That's something I provide for you. If I give up Pinkman, well, then you're gonna be asking, 'Ol' Saul gives 'em up pretty easy. What's to keep him from giving me up?' Y'see, so, then where's the trust?

You want your criminal associate taken into police custody? We declare just enough so as to not arouse suspicion, so Walt's one time winnings becomes seed money for an investment. If you're committed enough, you can make any story work. I once told a woman I was Kevin Costner, and it worked because I believed it.

It is not a disaster. It's not a disaster, alright? She's not going to the cops, she's not telling a living soul. You wanna know why? One word: blowback. If she blabs, it'll be a disaster - for her. That DEA brother-in-law? Screwed! You were right under his nose. He'll be lucky if they let him bust glue sniffers at the hobby shop. The kids? Paging Dr. Phil! 'My daddy's a drug dealer and my mommy turned him in!' And the house? Gone! The feds will come in and RICO her and the kids out on the street. Good luck arguing with them on that, noooo. It's not gonna happen. She's bluffing. And she knows it.

Hello. Welcome. What a pleasure it is to have you. Just gonna call you Skyler if that's okay. It's a lovely name. It reminds me of the big, beautful sky. Walter always told me how lucky he was, prior to recent unfortunate events. Clearly his taste in women is the same as his taste in lawyers: only the very best with just the right amount of dirty.

Walter, I'm your lawyer. Anything you say to me is totally privileged. I'm not in the shakedown racket. I'm a lawyer. Even drug dealers need lawyers, right? Especially drug dealers.

No shit! Right now you're Fredo. But, y'know, with some sound advice and proper introductions, who knows? I'll tell you one thing: you've got the right product.

If you're committed enough, you can make any story work. I once told a woman I was Kevin Costner, and it worked because I believed it.

It is not a disaster. It's not a disaster, alright? She's not going to the cops, she's not telling a living soul. You wanna know why? One word: blowback. If she blabs, it'll be a disaster - for her. That DEA brother-in-law? Screwed! You were right under his nose. He'll be lucky if they let him bust glue sniffers at the hobby shop. The kids? Paging Dr. Phil! 'My daddy's a drug dealer and my mommy turned him in!' And the house? Gone! The feds will come in and RICO her and the kids out on the street. Good luck arguing with them on that, noooo. It's not gonna happen. She's bluffing. And she knows it.

Hello. Welcome. What a pleasure it is to have you. Just gonna call you Skyler if that's okay. It's a lovely name. It reminds me of the big, beautful sky. Walter always told me how lucky he was, prior to recent unfortunate events. Clearly his taste in women is the same as his taste in lawyers: only the very best with just the right amount of dirty.

Walter, I'm your lawyer. Anything you say to me is totally privileged. I'm not in the shakedown racket. I'm a lawyer. Even drug dealers need lawyers, right? Especially drug dealers.

No shit! Right now you're Fredo. But, y'know, with some sound advice and proper introductions, who knows? I'll tell you one thing: you've got the right product. Anything that gets the DEA's panties in this big a bunch, you're onto something special. And I would like to be a small and silent part of it. Food for thought, yeah? So if you want to make more money and keep the money that you make, better call Saul!

Better safe than sorry. That's my motto. Yeah, you do seem to have a little 'shit creek' action going. You know, FYI, you can buy a paddle. Did you not plan for this contingency? I mean the Starship Enterprise had a self-destruct button. I'm just saying.

Look, let's start with some tough love, alright? Ready for this? Here it goes: you two suck at peddling meth. Period. Good! 'Oh boo-hoo, I won't cook meth anymore!' You're a crybaby! Who needs you?! Hey, I'm unplugging the website, so no more money laundering! How do you like that?!

Great, perfect you know... this is just. I told her you were my A Team. Oh, hello Mrs. White, the good news is the IRS has been paid off, the bad news is... ach, Jesus!

What am I eighth grade hall monitor? Current whereabouts? Let me tell you something, Mike. There are rules to this lawyer thing. Attorney client privilege, that's a big one. That's something I provide for you! If I give up Pinkman, then you're gonna be asking, old Saul gives 'em up pretty easy what's to keep him from giving me up? You see, so then, where's the trust?

Today's your lucky day. Look around, kiddo - it's all yours. You are now the owner of this fine establishment. Free? Oh ladies, cover your ears. No... not free. Look, hey... this is a squeaky clean, highly profitable (at least potentially), local institution. Look the bottom with favor by the chamber of commerce, better business bureau at three-hundred and twelve thousand dollars, it's a steal.

Don't you get it? On the outside it's a nail salon right, on the inside it's the best money laundering a growing boy could ask for. Wait, wait! Come back here. Sit. Come on, come on... humor me here for a second. You know you need to launder your money, right? Do you understand the basics of it - placement, layering, integration. Well, you wanna stay out of jail don't ya? You wanna keep your money and your freedom. Cause I got three little letters for ya, I - R - S. If they can get Capone, they can get you.

Hey look, here's you right - pink... Pinkman, get it? Here's your cash. You're out on the town, yeah you're partying hardy, you're knocking boots with the chicky babes and aww! Who's this? It's the tax man and he's looking at you. And what does he see? He sees a young fella, big fancy house, unlimited cash supply and no job. Now what is the conclusion the tax man makes? Aaaaannnt! Wrong! Millions times worse - you're a tax cheat. What do they do? They take every penny and you go in the can for felony tax evasion. Ouch! What was your mistake? You didn't launder your money! Now, you give me your money, okay that's called placement.

Hand me that little thing, bin. This is the nail salon, right. I take your dirty money and I slip it into the salon's nice clean cash flow - that's called layering. Final step - integration. The revenues from the salon go to the owner - that's you! Your filthy drug money has been transformed into nice clean taxable income brought to you by a savvy investment in a thriving business. Yeah and if you wanna stay a criminal and not become say a convict, then maybe you should grow up and listen to your lawyer.

Look, let's crunch some numbers. How much money are we laundering? Yeah, apparently. All right, $16,000 laundered at 75 cents on the dollar, minus my fee, which is 17%, comes out to $9,960. Congratulations, you've just left your family a second hand Subaru.
